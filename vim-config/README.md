While completing the .vimrc file I used a prompt that gave me the outline of what the content in a dotfile should look like. Once I got the basic idea of how the contents should look like, I started by adding in my choice of color scheme and vim improvemnt plugin via vundle.Once I added in all of my plugins and my color scheme, I started by getting an understanding about how to write each line of the script to complete the three tasks of copying the .vimrc file from the repo folderto the user's home directory, installing Vundle if it does not exist and that the script will install my vim setup. 

After completing my script and the .vimrc i began by troubleshooting while making edits to the contents and began analyzing the outcomes. After each troubleshoot was complete, my script was able to run and work without any issues.
